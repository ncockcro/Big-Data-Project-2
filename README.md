# Big-Data-Project-2
This program is designed to use Scala and use the Spark framework to read in a pre-formatted file and set the starting timestamp to be the key and the source packet time, destination packet time, and the user's ip to be the values. With this info, I reduced by keys and found the time stamps with either the highest source packet time or destination packet time for each time stamp. From there I made a new map with the user's ip from the highest packet times for each time stamp and mapped a constant of 1 to be the value. From there I counted how many times a user's ip appeared and whoever's ip appeared the most was declared to be a ddoser with the information given.
